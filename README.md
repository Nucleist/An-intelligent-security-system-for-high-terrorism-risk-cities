This is the code for my science fair project: "ISTC". You can check the in-depth summary of my work through this link :

The system is based on a 3-part-cyclic process : prediction thanks to a natural language processing method and latest social media posts, detection thanks to an autonomous sound weapon detector and an instant solution through a notification system connecting the user to the system's server using Firebase. Many enhancements could be added when it comes to networks' architectures, optimization methods, hyperparameters tuning ...

I've been working on this research since June 2018 and as far as i could tell I have enjoyed building and evaluating each part of the project's architecture. I think that self-learning is a tremendous process and sharing my efforts could be helpful for new data science enthusiasts. Go through the code and try analyzing it using the link above.

I believe that by combining recent frameworks with cutting-edge research in deep learning, we could deploy a sustainable platform that aims at minimizing the time response to terrorist attacks. Thus, the casualties could be reduced.
Feel free to play with my implementations and give me your feedback !
